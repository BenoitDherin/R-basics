They\r\nare meant to help you take notes during class. Clone this repository and launch the ipython notebook in it. \r\n\r\nTo spare you installation troubles, we have created a linux virtual box (called \"OskiBox\"), where everything you'll need for this class has already been installed. You'll find detailed instructions on how to set up the virtual box [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ybM5k73-b38dvYDbr8QX01l15SNgfysdS7wDmlQDBcY/pub).\r\n\r\nYou'll also be able to access cloud machine we set up for the class by following the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/14VhcyR_ii19-jnJwUjvOeJe26OJSVZpCjGrsiBnSBxA/pub).\r\n\r\nYou'll be able to access an html version of the skeleton notebooks, filled in with what we type in during class, at the following links, or at the following website: [http://benoitdherin.github.io/R-basics](http://benoitdherin.github.io/R-basics).\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
