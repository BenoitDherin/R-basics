R Basics
========

The iPython notebooks in this repository are skeletons that we will fill in together during class time. They
are meant to help you take notes during class. Clone this repository and launch the ipython notebook in it. 

To spare you installation troubles, we have created a linux virtual box (called "OskiBox"), where everything you'll need for this class has already been installed. You'll find detailed instructions on how to set up the virtual box [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ybM5k73-b38dvYDbr8QX01l15SNgfysdS7wDmlQDBcY/pub).

You'll also be able to access cloud machine we set up for the class by following the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/14VhcyR_ii19-jnJwUjvOeJe26OJSVZpCjGrsiBnSBxA/pub).

You'll be able to access an html version of the skeleton notebooks, filled in with what we type in during class, at the following links, or at the following website: [http://benoitdherin.github.io/R-basics](http://benoitdherin.github.io/R-basics).
